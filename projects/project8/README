In project 8, I optimized constant expressions through constant folding.  In particular, I enabled
folding of expressions containing addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parenthesis.
They all work together so an expression like "(3 + 3) * 5" should map directly to "30".

In order to use this optimization, run the compiler with the "-t" command flag.  This enables
tree trimming profiling and optimization.  This constant folding works by trimming the parse tree
which is why it is in this section.  The profiling results should print out in the console.
